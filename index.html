                Professionally trained, our chefs first set out to learn the closely guarded recipes and secrets of the regional classic dishes, and then reinterpret the traditional Cameroonian cuisine in an innovative way using ingredients that are local, in-season and at the peak of flavour.
                
                The result is an array of satisfying dishes that retain their bright, bold and rich flavours. Every dish encapsulates a piece of history, epics, legends, emotions, humanity and art that is celebratory of the culture, the people and the region we call home. We’re passionate about food and love to share this passion with you.
